The macro.h and vcs.h file have been moved from the dasm machines folder into the folder containing the code we are compiling.

The compile.bat file will execute dasm and compile the rom file. You should include the location of dasm in your OS environment PATH. 

Please refer to your OS documentation on how to do that.
